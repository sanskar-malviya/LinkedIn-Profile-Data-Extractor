Currently, I work as a Data Analyst at Anaxee Digital Runners, where I design end-to-end analytics solutions, build LLM-powered RAG systems, create interactive geospatial dashboards, and automate insight generation for large-scale GTM and climate projects.I have practical experience working with Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, LLMs, and cloud platforms, and I actively build AI-driven tools that reduce manual effort and improve decision-making speed. My work spans data modeling, AI workflows, retrieval-augmented generation, dashboards, and real-time analytics.Beyond academics and work, I have actively taken leadership and collaborative roles — serving as Photography Head of AMOGH Photography Club, managing a 75+ member team, and collaborating with brands like Nikon, DJI, and Insta360 during major university events. I’ve also been part of the Google Developer Student Club, participated in national-level hackathons, and consistently engaged in technical and creative communities.I am deeply enthusiastic about AI engineering, data science, and software development, and I am always looking to upgrade my skills and contribute to impactful, innovation-driven projects at the intersection of AI, data, and business.I am a Computer Science Engineer, Data Analyst, and AI Engineer with a strong passion for building intelligent, data-driven solutions that solve real-world business problems.\n\nMy journey into computer science began with a natural curiosity about how computers work beyond the screen — a curiosity that has evolved into hands-on experience with AI systems, data analytics, and automation.
